## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd alx_travel_app
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up MySQL database:

```bash
# Using Docker
docker run --name alx_travel_mysql \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword \
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=alx_travel_db \
    -e MYSQL_USER=alx_travel_user \
    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=alx_travel_pass \
    -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:latest
```

5. Create a `.env` file in the project root (use `.env.example` as a template):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

6. Run migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

7. Create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

8. (Optional) Seed the database with sample data:

```bash
python manage.py seed
```

This will create:

- 7 sample users (5 regular users, 2 staff users)
- 14 property listings (2 per user)
- Multiple bookings and reviews
  All sample users have the password: `password123`

## Running the Application

## Background Tasks with Celery

This project uses Celery with RabbitMQ for handling background tasks such as sending email notifications.

### Setting up RabbitMQ

1. Install RabbitMQ:

```bash
sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
```

2. Start RabbitMQ service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
```

### Running Celery

1. Start the Celery worker:

```bash
celery -A alx_travel_app worker -l info
```

2. (Optional) Start Celery beat for periodic tasks:

```bash
celery -A alx_travel_app beat -l info
```

### Email Configuration

The application uses SMTP for sending emails. To configure email settings:

1. Copy the email configuration from `.env.example` to your `.env` file
2. Update the email settings with your SMTP credentials
3. For Gmail, you'll need to:
   - Enable 2-factor authentication
   - Generate an App Password
   - Use the App Password as EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD

### Features

- Asynchronous email notifications for booking confirmations
- Background task processing with Celery
- Email notifications using SMTP

## Docker Setup

You can run the entire application stack using Docker Compose:

1. Create a `.env` file from the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

2. Build and start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start the following services:

- Django web application (http://localhost:8000)
- MySQL database
- Redis for Celery results backend
- RabbitMQ for message broker
- Celery worker for background tasks

You can access:

- RabbitMQ management interface at http://localhost:15672 (guest/guest)
- Django admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin
- API documentation at http://localhost:8000/swagger/
- Mailpit web interface at http://localhost:8025

3. Run migrations inside the container:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

4. Create a superuser:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

5. (Optional) Seed the database:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py seed
```

To stop the services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To stop the services and remove all data (volumes):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Email Testing with Mailpit

The application uses Mailpit for email testing in the development environment. When running with Docker Compose:

- SMTP server is available at port 1025
- Web interface to view emails is available at http://localhost:8025
- No authentication required for SMTP
- All emails are caught by Mailpit and won't be actually sent
- You can view HTML and plain text versions of emails
- Supports attachments and different email clients

You can access:

- RabbitMQ management interface at http://localhost:15672 (guest/guest)
- Django admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin
- API documentation at http://localhost:8000/swagger/
- Mailpit web interface at http://localhost:8025

### Testing Email Functionality

The project uses Mailpit for local email testing. All emails sent by the application in development will be caught by Mailpit and can be viewed in its web interface at http://localhost:8025. No emails will actually be sent to real email addresses.

### Common Commands

- Stop all services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

- View logs of all services:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

- View logs of a specific service:

```bash
docker compose logs [service_name]  # e.g., docker compose logs web
```

- Restart a specific service:

```bash
docker compose restart [service_name]  # e.g., docker compose restart web
```

- Run Django management commands:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py [command]
```

### Troubleshooting

1. **Database Connection Issues**:

   - Ensure the MySQL container is running: `docker compose ps`
   - Check MySQL logs: `docker compose logs db`
   - Verify database credentials in `.env` file

2. **Email Testing Issues**:

   - Ensure Mailpit container is running
   - Check Mailpit logs: `docker compose logs mailpit`
   - Verify email settings in Django settings

3. **Container Start-up Issues**:
   - Remove all containers and volumes: `docker compose down -v`
   - Rebuild all containers: `docker compose up --build`

### Development Workflow

1. Make changes to your code
2. The Django development server will automatically reload
3. If you modify dependencies:
   - Update `requirements.txt`
   - Rebuild containers: `docker compose up --build`
4. If you modify models:
   - Create migrations: `docker compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations`
   - Apply migrations: `docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate`
